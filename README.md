1. imported required libraries.
2. uploaded data.
3. read data
4. visualized some samples of images.
5. explored the data
6. pre-process data using data augmentation
7. split data into train and test
8. built Custome CNN model
9. compiled and optimized the model
10. fit the model with data
11. evaluate the performance of the model
12. plot the performance.
